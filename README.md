## üîß Features

* Trained on Ames Housing Dataset
* Handles both numerical and categorical features
* Preprocessing includes:

  * Imputation for missing values
  * Feature scaling (numerical)
  * One-hot encoding (categorical)
* Random Forest Regressor as the core model
* Log-transformation of the target (`SalePrice`) for better performance

## üì¶ Requirements

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn flask joblib
```

---

## üöÄ How to Run the Project

1. **Download the Data:**

   * Download `train.csv` and `test.csv` from the [Kaggle Ames Housing dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)
   * Place them in the project root folder

2. **Train the Model:**

   ```bash
   python data_processing.py
   ```

3. **Start the Web App:**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`

# End-to-End Data Science Project

This repository contains an end-to-end data science project, likely focused on a regression problem given the presence of house price-related files and RMSE/R-squared metrics. The project covers data preprocessing, model training, and deployment using Flask.

## Key Components and Files

  * **`app.py`**: This is the main Flask application file responsible for serving the web interface. It uses `render_template('index.html')` to display the front-end, suggesting a web-based interaction for the trained model.
  * **`data_processing.py`**: This script likely handles the entire data preprocessing pipeline. The screenshots show output related to:
      * Loading `train.csv` and `test.csv`.
      * Displaying `train_data` and `test_data` shapes.
      * Showing `info()` details for both datasets, including column names, non-null counts, and data types.
      * Identifying and reporting missing values in both `Train data` and `Test data`.
      * Performing preprocessing steps that result in `X_train_processed` and `X_test_processed` with shapes `(1460, 287)` and `(1459, 287)` respectively, indicating a significant increase in features after transformations (e.g., one-hot encoding).
  * **`categorical_features.pkl`**: A pickled file likely containing a list or a transformer for the categorical features identified during data preprocessing.
  * **`numerical_features.pkl`**: A pickled file likely containing a list or a transformer for the numerical features identified during data preprocessing.
  * **`house_price_model.pkl`**: This is the serialized (pickled) machine learning model, presumably trained to predict house prices.
  * **`house_price_preprocessor.pkl`**: This is the serialized (pickled) preprocessing pipeline or transformer used to prepare new input data for the `house_price_model`.
  * **`requirements.txt`**: Lists all the Python dependencies required to run this project.
  * **`test.csv`**: The test dataset used for model evaluation.
  * **`train.csv`**: The training dataset used for model development and training.
  * **`templates/index.html`**: The HTML template file for the Flask web application's home page. This is crucial for the web interface.
  * **`Figure_1.png`**, **`Figure_2.png`**: These are likely image files representing visualizations or plots generated during the exploratory data analysis (EDA) or model evaluation phases of the project.

## Data Overview (from screenshots)

The project deals with a dataset containing house-related information. Key observations from the `Test Info` and `Train Info` sections include:

  * **Total Columns**: 80 columns.
  * **Target Variable**: Likely `SalePrice` (present in `train.csv`, inferred from the problem type).
  * **Data Types**: A mix of `int64`, `float64`, and `object` (categorical) data types.
  * **Missing Values**: Significant missing values are present in several columns, requiring imputation or handling during preprocessing. Some examples with high missing counts:
      * `PoolQC` (1453 in train, 1456 in test)
      * `MiscFeature` (1446 in train, 1448 in test)
      * `Alley` (1369 in train, 1352 in test)
      * `Fence` (1179 in train, 1169 in test)
      * `FireplaceQu` (690 in train, 730 in test)
      * `LotFrontage` (259 in train, 227 in test)
      * `GarageType`, `GarageYrBlt`, `GarageFinish`, `GarageQual`, `GarageCond`, `BsmtExposure`, `BsmtFinType1`, `BsmtFinType2`, `BsmtQual`, `BsmtCond`, `BsmtExposure`, `MasVnrArea`, `MasVnrType` also have missing values, though fewer.

## Preprocessing Details (from `data_processing.py` output)

  * The preprocessing step transforms the original features.
  * `X_train_processed` shape: `(1460, 287)`
  * `X_test_processed` shape: `(1459, 287)`
  * `y_log_shape`: `(1460,)` (suggests the target variable `SalePrice` was log-transformed, which is common for skewed distributions in regression problems).

## Model Performance

The model's performance on the validation set (log-transformed target) is reported as:

  * **RMSE**: 0.1448
  * **R-squared**: 0.8876

These metrics indicate a reasonably good fit, with an R-squared of 0.8876 suggesting that approximately 88.76% of the variance in the log-transformed house prices is explained by the model.
